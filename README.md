# MyHomeWorkCleaningData

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

* I downloaded the .zip file, I unzipped it, and I made all the work inside the directory that was created.

* I put all my work in a single script file: run_analysis.R

* The style is: I followed the 5 items listed in the assignment. I copied the item, then, there are a couple of lines with what I intend to do. If I have doubts about what they as from me, I say them. Also, I write down the decission that I took, regarding the doubt.

* The most important thing is that for item 5, I was not 100% sure if they were asking for the mean in all the variables of the original sets, or only for those variables that we selected in item 2.

I decided to do both, since it means only repeating the instructions.

The outcome is:

tidy_all.txt <- With the averages by activity and subject for all the variables
tidy_selection.txt <- With the averages by activity and subject for means and standard deviations

* For the name and units of the columns, I refer to the original files features.txt and features_info.txt

* Modifications to what it is presented there is included in CodeBook.md
